## Why the Mages were banished
Centuries ago this kingdom had a strong belief in faith. The people worshipped these powerful entities known to them as Angels. However, not everyone blindly prostrated themselves before them. Scientists, called Mages at the time, dedicated their time into research of the arcane arts known as magic. They wanted to make life easier for the people. Research into magic were reaching their peak. The Angels saw the threat of magic and convinced the King at the time to banish them for heretical practices. The Mages left and found refuge in the Monster Realm as part of their research. Now that they had no one to stop their studies, they quickly advanced on their own in the Monster Realm creating a highly developed society that we now see in the present day story.

## Relation to other Kingdoms
While every kingdom has their own expanding military force, it is not for the use of war with other humans, but for defense against the creatures that roam the lands. Very rarely would humans go to war with one another. This would only occur if a new ruler were to have taken the throne and have violent decisions be made. Traveling merchants are commonplace. They risk their lives to make a living and to travel to exotic lands.
