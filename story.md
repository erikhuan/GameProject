Title Screen: New Game, Continue, Options

Intro - The sky is dark with a heavy overcast. A crimson glow fills a village as houses are ablaze. The smell of burning wood and screams waft through the air. People are in a panic running past You as they are being chased by monsters. You fight your way through.

-Tutorial stage-

You walk/run past the crowd and approach  a monster. An armored knight with sword in hand. Attack. Following there is a blockade. A weak point at the top can be hit with an arrow. You must jump up platforms to reach it. After clearing the way you face a spear knight with shield. Roll to get past his defense and beat him. After there is an underpass you can get past by rolling. You reach an open area.

-Tutorial Boss-

A very large knight with a sword and shield. The knight will try to actively block attacks with his shield. The player must take advantage of rolling to defeat the boss. Afterwards You walk ahead to find a Girl in white. She sees you and immediately runs off. As you chase after her, Fade to black...

-Patrol-

Felix: . .ake u...
You: . . .
Felix: Wake up.
You: ......
Felix: Wake up!
You: ...!

You wake up in bed in the barracks to see your ally waking you up.

Felix: Get up, it's morning! Get ready for morning instruction.

You get out of bed. There is a chest in the room. It contains your sword and bow. Unless you retrieve them you can't leave the room. Attempting to do so starts a prompt that suggests you grab your equipment. After you grab your things you head out of the room outside for briefing.

Captain: ... And that's all for today.

You walk up to the Captain.

Captain: Ah, You. I've got a simple assignment for you two today. Go patrol the Forest. There's been complaints of infestation of Wasps lately. We need to locate their Hive and eliminate them. Report back after you've completed your task.

*Insert Felix dialogue

From this point, You are free to wander around this portion of Town and into the Forest.

-Knight Encounter-

After exploring the Forest you come across a rope bridge. As the player walks onto the rope bridge a knight in black armor approaches. And a boss battle starts.

Option 1 Cut the Bridge

The knight plummets into the ravine while the boy falls atop a ledge to the side. The boy makes his way down to find the knight heavily injured, now determined to kill the boy. Continue the fight and defeat the knight. Afterwards You are forced to meet back with Felix and head back to Town as the way ahead is currently impassable. Fade to black.

Option 2 Fight

If You manage to defeat the Black Knight,

Black Knight: You fight well for a young one. However I'm afraid I must end this duel of ours.

He proceeds to knocks you out. Fade to black.

(2nd play through) not sure if I'm gonna implement this
-The Girl- temp

You wake up in a regal bedroom as your maids are helping you get ready.

Maid: Good morning Princess.

The maids help you get dressed. After you get dressed Advisor comes in to greet you.

Advisor: Good morning Princess. Today we  will be having a special learning session. We will be exploring the Human Realm and teaching you how to use your powers. Accompanying us will be one of your loyal Knights. Come see me at the foyer when you are ready.

At this point you can free roam around the castle.

Advisor: Are you ready Princess? Very well, then let us be off.

The three of you enter a portal and warp to the Forest.

Advisor: Knight go ahead and keep watch.

Knight walks ahead.

Advisor: Now Princess, in the Human Realm you must be aware of the dangers that are present to even us monsters. Savage creatures are plentiful in the Human Realm, but most should not be a problem as long as they are not provoked. You must be cautious of Red Eyed creatures. They will attack without warning. Simply fend them off with your Magic and in time they should leave you alone. If need be you can also require the aid of friendly creatures nearby to aid you. Try to get that small creature there to follow you.

. . .

Advisor: Very good. Now if you are in danger it can serve as a distraction to lure any hostile creatures away. And don't worry about him. He will be fine. Your Magic should be enough to protect it long enough for him to lure and then escape the enemy. Now for our other agenda we need to find a Relic that is hidden somewhere.

Free roam, find Relic.

Advisor: Ah, that's it! Now Princess, as you may have noticed the Relic resonated when you were near it. Try to approach it and use your Magic to activate it.

. . .

Advisor: Excellent! What you have done is give power to the Relic, and now it can be used at anytime. 

If You fought the Black Knight fair and square the Girl asks for your safe return. Felix will find and carry you back.

If the Black Knight is killed,

Knight: Princess... I'm sorry you have to see me like this...

-After the Fight-

Regardless on how the fight went you return to town to rest up for the day and report to the Captain in the morning.

Captain: A Knight in Black armor you say? Strange. It is unlikely that any neighboring kingdoms have knights clad in that armor. And our scouts would have reported back any activities around the border. However, I won't overlook this knight issue. I'll have to bring it up to the higher ups. Until then continue your current mission, but proceed with caution. That is all.

You may now free roam again. As you make your way back to where you fought the knight you either cross the bridge or find that a path has opened at the bottom to the other side. In this section of the forest you start to see small hive structures amongst/in the trees and underground/everywhere. They will spawn Giant Wasps until the Hive is destroyed. You eventually make it to a cavern where a Giant Queen Wasp awaits you.

-Giant Queen Wasp Fight-

You must first destroy the nest surrounding her abdomen before being able to do any real damage. The Queen will fly around as Giant Wasps spawn to attack you.

After you defeat her a chest drops. Opening it increases your health bar.

-After Queen Wasp-

You head back to town automatically after finishing your task.

Captain: What? A Queen was there? And you defeated it? That was quite reckless of you, but seeing as how you are back I guess you're tougher than you look. Good work. With that out of the way I have another assignment for you. Our scouts have reported sightings of suspicious activity near the edge of the forest. Make whatever preparations you need and then go out and inspect the area.

As the Captain stated you can take your time before heading back into the forest. When you make it back to the area you fought the Queen Wasp you see a Girl in white like the one from your dream. Before you can speak with her she runs deeper into the forest. Eventually you enter a clearing.

-Panther Fight-

As you walk into the clearing you see the Girl tending to a wounded deer. She heals it with magic before a Flying Panther shows up. The deer carries the Girl off and you are left to fend off the Panther. When the Panther's health drops to half a second one appears.

When you deplete both their health bars they flee leaving a chest behind. In it you get a pair of Air Walks allowing you to double jump.

-After Panther-

With the Girl long gone by now you head back to town to give your report about the pair of Flying Panthers.

Captain: So that's whats been causing all the commotion huh? And you managed to chase them off too. Good work soldier. Go get some rest. You've certainly earned it.

You are free to do whatever you want until you head back to your bed to the barracks.

-Town West Gate-

A few days pass and you get new orders.

Captain: We've received word from the West gate that a Giant Sand Worm had been spotted off in the distance. It is unlikely that it will approach the main town area, but we have plans to expand our settlement out in the desert. Because of your excellent work this past week you've been chosen to assist the guards in charge of protecting the workers who will be building an outpost. You will receive further orders when you meet the Captain of the West Gate. Good luck.

You are given a letter that you can show the guards to let you through to the West part of town.

You can roam around town before heading to the West Gate. You show the guards the letter and they let you through.

At this point you can roam between both parts of town and the Forest.

Head to the West Barracks.

Captain: Are you the extra help we requested? (Yes/No)

No? Then why are you talking to me.

It wouldn't kill them to send more soldiers to help would it? Well let me brief you on the situation. We are planning to expand our settlement into the Desert. The plans have been in the works for a while, but as our team was ready to head out a Giant Sand Worm was spotted out in the distance. We aren't sure where it came from, but just to be safe we requested for extra security to guard the workers while they build the outpost. Once that's completed most monsters should be deterred from the nearby area. The problem is we don't know if that Worm will approach us while construction is in progress. So we need people like you to fend off any attacks if needed. We've formed pairs for easier mobility in the desert environment. Since you're the last person you'll be grouping up with another recruit of ours. Good luck, he's a tough guy to work with.
